# bootimage

Creates a bootable disk image from a Rust OS kernel.

## Installation

```
> cargo install bootimage
```

## Usage

First you need to add a dependency on the [`bootloader`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader) crate:

```toml
# in your Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
bootloader = "0.6.4"
```

**Note**: At least bootloader version `0.5.1` is required since `bootimage 0.7.0`. For earlier bootloader versions, use `bootimage 0.6.6`.

If you want to use a custom bootloader with a different name, you can use Cargo's [rename functionality](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#renaming-dependencies-in-cargotoml).

### Building

Now you can build the kernel project and create a bootable disk image from it by running:

```
bootimage build --target your_custom_target.json [other_args]
```

The command will invoke [`cargo xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild), forwarding all passed options. Then it will build the specified bootloader together with the kernel to create a bootable disk image.

If you prefer a cargo subcommand, you can use the equivalent `cargo bootimage` command:

```
cargo bootimage --target your_custom_target.json [other_args]
```

### Running

To run your kernel in QEMU, you can use `bootimage run`:

```
bootimage run --target your_custom_target.json [other_args] -- [qemu args]
```

All arguments after `--` are passed to QEMU. If you want to use a custom run command, see the _Configuration_ section below.

If you prefer working directly with cargo, you can use `bootimage runner` as a custom runner in your `.cargo/config`:

```toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "none")']
runner = "bootimage runner"
```

Now you can run your kernel through `cargo xrun --target [â€¦]`.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through a through a `[package.metadata.bootimage]` table in the `Cargo.toml` of your kernel. The following options are available:

```toml
    [package.metadata.bootimage]
    # This target is used if no `--target` is passed
    default-target = ""

    # The command invoked with the created bootimage (the "{}" will be replaced
    # with the path to the bootable disk image)
    # Applies to `bootimage run` and `bootimage runner`
    run-command = ["qemu-system-x86_64", "-drive", "format=raw,file={}"]

    # Additional arguments passed to the run command for non-test executables
    # Applies to `bootimage run` and `bootimage runner`
    run-args = []

    # The offset used for mapping physical memory when the `map_physical_memory` feature of the
    # bootloader crate is enabled. Must be given as a string, as TOML does not support unsigned
    # 64-bit integers.
    physical-memory-offset = ""

    # The virtual address where the kernel's stack should be placed. Must be given as a string,
    # as TOML does not support unsigned 64-bit integers.
    kernel-stack-address = ""

    # The size of the kernel's stack, in number of 4KiB pages.
    kernel-stack-size = 512

    # Additional arguments passed to the run command for test executables
    # Applies to `bootimage runner`
    test-args = []

    # An exit code that should be considered as success for test executables
    test-success-exit-code = {integer}

    # The timeout for running a test through `bootimage test` or `bootimage runner` (in seconds)
    test-timeout = 300
